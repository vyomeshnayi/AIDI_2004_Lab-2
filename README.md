Uploading Files to GitHub
Create a New Repository: Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the main page. Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New repository" from the dropdown menu. Provide a name for your repository, add an optional description, and choose the repository's visibility (public or private). Finally, click on the "Create repository" button.

Clone the Repository: On the repository's main page, you will see the repository's URL. Copy the URL or use the "Clone" button to copy it to your clipboard. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine, navigate to the directory where you want to store your project, and run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL you copied.

Add Your Project Files: Move or copy your project files into the local repository directory that was created by the clone command.

Stage and Commit Your Changes: Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the repository's directory, and run the following commands:


git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
The first command stages all the changes in the repository, and the second command commits the changes with a message describing the commit (e.g., "Initial commit").

Push Your Changes to GitHub: Run the following command to push your changes to GitHub:


git push origin master
This command sends your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

Verify Your Upload: Refresh your repository's page on GitHub, and you should see your project files listed.

Congratulations! You have successfully uploaded your project files to GitHub. You can continue working on your project, making changes, and pushing them to GitHub to keep your repository up to date.
